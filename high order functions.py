# Higher-order functions are functions that take one or more functions as arguments, return a function as a result or do both. Essentially, a higher-order function is a function that operates on other functions.

# Key Properties of Higher-Order Functions
# Taking functions as arguments: A higher-order function can accept other functions as parameters.
# Returning functions: A higher-order function can return a new function that can be called later.

# A higher-order function that takes another function as an argument
def fun(f, x):
    return f(x)

# A simple function to pass
def square(x):
    return x * x
res = fun(square, 5) # Using apply_function to apply the square function
print(res)
