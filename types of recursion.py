# Recursion can be broadly classified into two types: tail recursion and non-tail recursion. The main difference between them is related to what happens after recursive call.

# Tail Recursion: The recursive call is the last thing the function does, so nothing happens after it returns. Some languages can optimize this to work like a loop, saving memory.
# Non-Tail Recursion: The function does more work after the recursive call returns, so it canâ€™t be optimized into a loop.

def tail_fact(n, acc=1):
    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return acc
    # Tail recursive call with an accumulator
    else:
        return tail_fact(n-1, acc * n)

def nontail_fact(n):
    # Base case
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    # Non-tail recursive call because the multiplication happens after the call
    else:
        return n * nontail_fact(n-1)

# Example usage
print(tail_fact(5))  
print(nontail_fact(5))
